# Pizzeria software
**Project developed in C ++, using Object Oriented Programming concepts**

## About the project
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project is a software for a pizzeria to manage its activity, developed in Object Oriented Programming. The code contains an abstract class that contains only the pure virtual method of calculating the price of a product, and from this class derives the Pizza class. The production of any product includes a certain number of ingredients for which the names, quantities and unit price are known. The price of a product is given by the price of the ingredients plus labor. If the pizza is ordered online, 5% of the price is added to the payment for every 10 km covered by the employee who delivers at home. Also, the Menu template class manages the type of pizza sold, and the specialization for the Online Order type treats the types of vegetarian pizza in a separate accounting document from which results the total value collected from their sale.
